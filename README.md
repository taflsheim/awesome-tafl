## AI Programming

### General Concepts

*   **Minimax:** A classic game-playing algorithm that explores possible moves to a certain depth, assuming each player plays optimally.
    *   \[Add a brief explanation and links to resources explaining Minimax in general]
*   **Alpha-Beta Pruning:** An optimization technique for Minimax that reduces the search space.
    *   \[Add a brief explanation and links to resources explaining Alpha-Beta Pruning in general]
*   **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS):** A modern approach to game AI that uses random playouts to estimate the value of different moves.  Combines reinforcement learning and tree search.
    *   \[Add a brief explanation and links to resources explaining MCTS in general]
*   **Neuroevolution:** Using evolutionary algorithms to train neural networks.
    *   \[Add a brief explanation and links to resources explaining Neuroevolution in general]

### Evaluation Functions

*   **King Safety:** Evaluating the safety and escape potential of the king (distance to escape, degree of surrounding).
*   **Material Advantage:** Counting the number of pieces remaining.
*   **Mobility:** Assessing the freedom of movement of pieces.
*   **Control of Key Squares:** Identifying and controlling important squares on the board (ranks, files, center).
*   **Blockade Completeness**
*   **Teaching a Computer to Play Hnefatafl:** [http://tafl.cyningstan.com/post/1053/teaching-a-computer-to-play-hnefatafl](http://tafl.cyningstan.com/post/1053/teaching-a-computer-to-play-hnefatafl) - Discusses several things to check for in an evaluation function.
